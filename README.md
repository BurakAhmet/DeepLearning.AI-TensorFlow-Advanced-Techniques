## About This Specialization
  In this Specialization, you will expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types. You will learn how to optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. You will also explore generative deep learning including the ways AIs can create new content from Style Transfer to Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs.

## Contents
  - ### [Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow)
    
    * <b>[Week 1 - Functional APIs](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/1.%20Functional%20APIs)</b>: Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!
      
    * <b>[Week 2 - Custom Loss Functions](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/2.%20Custom%20Loss%20Functions)</b>: Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.
      
    * <b>[Week 3 - Custom Layers](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/3.%20Custom%20Layers)</b>: Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.
   
    * <b>[Week 4 - Custom Models](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/4.%20Custom%20Models)</b>: You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!
   
    * <b>[Week 5 - Callbacks](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/5.%20Callbacks)</b>: Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.

  - ### [Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow)
    
    * <b>[Week 1 - Differentiation and Gradients](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/1.%20Differentiation%20and%20Gradients)</b>: You will get a detailed look at the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow - tensor objects. For example, you will be able to describe the difference between eager mode and graph mode in TensorFlow, and explain why eager mode is very user friendly for you as a developer. You will also use TensorFlow tools to calculate gradients so that you don’t have to look for your old calculus textbooks next time you need to get a gradient!
   
    * <b>[Week 2 - Custom Training](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/2.%20Custom%20Training)</b>: You will build custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets. Being able to write your own training loops will give you more flexibility and visibility with your model training. You will also use a function to calculate the derivatives of functions so that you don’t have to look to your old calculus textbooks to calculate gradients.
   
    * <b>[Week 3 - Graph Mode](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/3.%20Graph%20Mode)</b>: You’ll learn about the benefits of generating code that runs in “graph mode”. You’ll take a peek at what graph code looks like, and you’ll practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlow’s tools, so that you don’t have to write the graph code yourself!
   
    * <b>[Week 4 - Distributed Training](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/4.%20Distributed%20Training)</b>: You will harness the power of distributed training to process more data and train larger models, faster. You’ll get an overview of various distributed training strategies and then practice working with two strategies, one that trains on multiple GPU cores, and the other that trains on multiple TPU cores.

  - ### [Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/3.%20Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow)
      * <b>[Week 1 - Introduction to Computer Vision](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/3.%20Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Vision)</b>: Get a conceptual overview of image classification, object localization, object detection, and image segmentation. Also be able to describe multi-label classification, and distinguish between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. In the rest of this course, you will apply TensorFlow to build object detection and image segmentation models.
