  - ### [Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow)
    Compare Functional and Sequential APIs, discover new models you can build with the Functional API, and build a model that produces multiple outputs including a Siamese network.
    
    * <b>[Week 1-Functional APIs](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/1.%20Functional%20APIs)</b>:
         Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!
