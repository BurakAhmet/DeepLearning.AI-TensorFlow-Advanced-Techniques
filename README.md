## About This Specialization
  In this Specialization, you will expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types. You will learn how to optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. You will also explore generative deep learning including the ways AIs can create new content from Style Transfer to Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs.

## Contents
  - ### [Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow)
    Compare Functional and Sequential APIs, discover new models you can build with the Functional API, and build a model that produces multiple outputs including a Siamese network.
    
    * <b>[Week 1 - Functional APIs](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/1.%20Functional%20APIs)</b>: Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!
      
    * <b>[Week 2 - Custom Loss Functions](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/2.%20Custom%20Loss%20Functions)</b>: Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.
      
    * <b>[Week 3 - Custom Layers](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/3.%20Custom%20Layers)</b>: Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.
   
    * <b>[Week 4 - Custom Models](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/1.%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/4.%20Custom%20Models)</b>: You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!
